1) Run the pplication

2) Add the number of order and SKU unit in Main method for output

3) ex-  5 * A, 5* B, 1*C

4) Observe the output

5) you can see Original price : 420 (5*50,5*30,1*20 = 420)
               Promotional Price :(130 + 90 = 220
               Total need to Pay : 420- 220 = 200

So the output is as expected

Test is passed
